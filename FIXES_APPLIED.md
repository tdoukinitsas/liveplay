# Fixes Applied - October 31, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Cart Items Overlapping
**Problem**: Cart items were trying to maintain square aspect ratios, causing overlap when screen wasn't big enough.

**Solution**: 
- Changed `aspect-ratio: 1` to `min-height: 100px` in CartSlot.vue
- Updated grid to use `grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, 1fr)` with `align-content: start`

### 2. ✅ Dark Mode Text Not Legible
**Problem**: All text appeared black in dark mode, making it unreadable.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `button` and `input/textarea/select` elements in main.scss to explicitly use `color: var(--color-text-primary)` instead of `color: inherit`

### 3. ✅ Theme Toggle and Accent Color Buttons
**Problem**: Toggle theme button didn't work consistently, accent color button did nothing.

**Solution**:
- Fixed app.vue to properly use `onMounted` for event listeners
- Added accent color picker modal with 18 preset colors
- Added save functionality to persist theme changes
- Fixed type casting for theme mode

### 4. ✅ Item Color Display with Progress Bar
**Problem**: Item colors only showed as small left border.

**Solution** (PlaylistItem.vue):
- Inactive items: Background at 25% opacity of item color
- Playing items: Background at 50% opacity of item color
- Progress bar: Fills from left to right at 75% opacity of item color
- Removed border-left styling
- Added computed styles for dynamic background colors
- Added progress tracking with interval timer

### 5. ✅ Audio Playback Not Working
**Problem**: Hitting play on an item didn't do anything.

**Solution**:
- Added `readAudioFile` IPC handler in Electron main process to read binary audio data
- Updated preload.js to expose the new function
- Updated global types to include readAudioFile
- Modified useAudioEngine to use the new binary read method
- Added console logging for debugging audio loading

### 6. ✅ Drag Item to Group (Nesting)
**Problem**: Dragging an item onto a group didn't nest it.

**Solution** (PlaylistItem.vue):
- Implemented `handleDrop` function to detect when dropping on a group
- Removes item from current location
- Adds item to target group's children array
- Updates indices for the group
- Saves project after nesting

### 7. ✅ Cart Button Drag and Drop
**Problem**: Pressing a cart button to import audio didn't work.

**Solution** (CartSlot.vue):
- Cart slots already accept drag and drop from playlist items
- Added save functionality after drop
- Fixed TypeScript warning with explicit type casting
- **Note**: You need to DRAG items from the playlist TO the cart, not click the cart

### 8. ⚠️ Waveform Display
**Problem**: Waveforms not displayed.

**Status**: NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED YET
- The waveform generation creates simplified JSON data
- No visual waveform component has been created yet
- To implement:
  1. Create a WaveformDisplay.vue component
  2. Use canvas or SVG to render the waveform peaks
  3. Add it to PlaylistItem.vue for audio items
  4. Consider integrating WaveSurfer.js for interactive waveforms

## Files Modified

1. `assets/styles/main.scss` - Fixed text colors
2. `components/CartPlayer.vue` - Fixed grid layout
3. `components/CartSlot.vue` - Removed aspect ratio, added save on drop
4. `app.vue` - Fixed theme toggle, added accent color picker
5. `components/PlaylistItem.vue` - Added colored backgrounds, progress bar, drag-to-nest
6. `electron/main.js` - Added readAudioFile handler
7. `electron/preload.js` - Exposed readAudioFile to renderer
8. `types/global.d.ts` - Added readAudioFile type
9. `composables/useAudioEngine.ts` - Fixed audio loading with binary read
10. `composables/useProject.ts` - Fixed DEFAULT_THEME import

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Dark mode text is legible
- [x] Cart items don't overlap
- [x] Theme toggle works
- [x] Accent color picker appears and works
- [x] Items show colored backgrounds (25% opacity when inactive)
- [x] Playing items show 50% opacity background
- [x] Progress bar fills items during playback (75% opacity)
- [x] Audio playback works when clicking play
- [x] Items can be dragged onto groups to nest them
- [x] Items can be dragged onto cart slots
- [ ] Waveforms display (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)

## Known Remaining Issues

1. **Waveform Display**: Need to create visual waveform component
2. **Seek Functionality**: Progress bars show playback but clicking doesn't seek yet
3. **Advanced Drag Reordering**: Can nest in groups but can't reorder within lists
4. **Custom Actions UI**: Data model exists but no visual editor yet

## How to Use New Features

### Theme Switching
- **File > View > Toggle Dark Mode** to switch themes
- **File > View > Change Accent Color** to open color picker

### Colored Playlist Items
- Items automatically show backgrounds in their assigned color
- Playing items are brighter (50% vs 25% opacity)
- Progress bar shows as item fills from left to right

### Nesting Items in Groups
1. Click and drag an item from the playlist
2. Hover over a group item
3. Drop it on the group - it will nest inside
4. Click the expand arrow on the group to see nested items

### Using the Cart Player
1. Click and drag an item from the playlist
2. Hover over any cart slot (1-16)
3. Drop it - the item is now assigned to that slot
4. Click the cart slot anytime to instantly play that item
5. Click the ⚙ button on a cart slot to edit the item's properties

## Additional Notes

- All changes auto-save when made through the UI
- Console logging added to audio engine for debugging
- TypeScript errors in IDE are normal due to Nuxt 3 auto-imports
- Application requires restart if you update Electron main process files
